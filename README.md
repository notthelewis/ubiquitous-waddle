Practicing algorithms and general programming

The aim of this project is to work on general programming problems, to sharpen my skills.
I'm gonna start out in C, but I may add more languages.

The directory structure:

  - ``` largest_power_of_two ``` 
      - Has various solutions for working out the largest power of two in a given number.
